#  OrbitalHive — Building the Circular Economy of Space  

### Developed by **Team NEILA**  
🏆 **2nd Place Winner – NASA Space Apps Challenge 2025 (Local Round – Nirma University)**

## 🚀 About the Project  
**OrbitalHive** is a next-generation orbital platform designed to **commercialize Low Earth Orbit (LEO)** sustainably.  
Our idea combines **autonomous debris extraction**, **in-situ 3D manufacturing**, and **in-space biomanufacturing (ISBM)** to build a **self-sustaining circular economy in orbit**.  

The system captures and analyzes orbital debris, recycles usable material into new satellite components, and leverages microgravity for pharmaceutical and biomaterial synthesis — turning space waste into opportunity.  

OrbitalHive represents the future of **responsible space commercialization**, bridging **AI, robotics, and biotechnology** for a cleaner and more productive orbit.
